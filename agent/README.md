# Onchain Agent Powered by AgentKit

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with `create-onchain-agent`.

It integrates [AgentKit](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit) to provide AI-driven interactions with on-chain capabilities.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, configure your environment variables:

```sh
mv .env.local .env
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `CDP_API_KEY_ID` - Your CDP API Key ID from [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/access/api)
- `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET` - Your CDP API Key Secret
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API Key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` - Your OpenWeatherMap API Key (free) from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- `NETWORK_ID` - (Optional) Network to use, defaults to `base-sepolia`

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the project.

## Configuring Your Agent

You can [modify your configuration](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit/tree/main/typescript/agentkit#usage) of the agent. By default, your agentkit configuration occurs in the `/api/agent/prepare-agentkit.ts` file, and agent instantiation occurs in the `/api/agent/create-agent.ts` file.

### 1. Select Your LLM

Modify the OpenAI model instantiation to use the model of your choice.

### 2. Select Your Wallet Provider

AgentKit requires a **Wallet Provider** to interact with blockchain networks.

### 3. Select Your Action Providers

Action Providers define what your agent can do. You can use built-in providers or create your own.

## Features

### üå§Ô∏è Weather Information

This agent includes weather functionality powered by OpenWeatherMap API. You can ask questions like:

- "What's the weather in London?"
- "How's the weather in New York today?"
- "Tell me the weather conditions in Tokyo"

The agent will provide current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

### üè¶ Onchain Capabilities

All standard AgentKit onchain capabilities are available, including:

- Wallet management and transactions
- Token transfers and swaps
- Smart contract interactions
